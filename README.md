# Pervasive-Biomedical-Informatics

The term "Pervasive Biomedical Informatics" - PBI is conined by Me and my colleague Poulami Majumder.

Pervasive Biomedical Informatics
(PBI) is a novel domain of research
that is combined of pervasive
computing, biomedical engineering and
informatics. In this article we coin the
“Pervasive Biomedical Informatics” to
design and imply a new area that could
bring a new horizon in smart healthcare
system. To know about this term first
we should know about each part of
this term. Pervasive means anything
at anytime, anywhere. It helps to make
effective communication in every useful
device like laptop, mobile or smart
devices by using computational method
to minimize the need of interaction with
computer. Pervasive computing devices
are network connected and constantly
available. Pervasive computing is energy
constraint, consumer safe and logistics.

It is widely applied in healthcare
system. Biomedical Engineering is the
field where the engineering principles
are applied and design concepts to
medicine and biology for healthcare
purposes. In this context, the informatics
would involve processing, analytics,
management, and prediction of clinical
or pervasive biomedical data. Further,
Internet of Things (IoT), big data,
and machine learning (ML) shall be
incorporated within this proposed field
of PBI to enhance the qualitative and
predictive measures of aforementioned
pool of data. This proposed applied field shall establish the interaction between
humans and information alongside
the construction of interfaces,
organizations, technologies and
systems.


Main objectives are a) spreading awareness among the individuals
through high quality information
processing system, b) make the
resource constraint and low time
consuming system, c) use of easily
accessible devices like low cost smart
devices, mobile, laptop, d) to predict
the health condition of a patient by
using data science, machine learning
and telecommunication and alarming
the doctors or care givers for taking
necessary action.
